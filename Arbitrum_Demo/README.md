1. I installed and registed my metamask account
2. I used the Chainlink faucet to obtain Arbitrum Sepolia test ETH.
3. I created a new workspace with the name Arbitrum_Demo and added a new file as HelloArbitrum.col.
4. I created a constructor and a function to update my contract.
5. I deployed my contract and performed some transactions.
I finally used Arbitrum Sepolia Explorer (Arbiscan) to search for my contract to view deployment details.
